# Pneumonia Detection App

## Overview

The Pneumonia Detection App is a desktop application designed to detect pneumonia from chest X-ray images using deep learning. The application features a user-friendly interface built with PyQt5 and utilizes a TensorFlow-based model for image recognition. It provides real-time results through visual and audio feedback.

## Features

- **Image Upload:** Allows users to upload chest X-ray images.
- **Prediction:** Classifies the uploaded image to detect pneumonia.
- **Result Feedback:** Displays results via pop-ups and text-to-speech.
- **Animated Loading GIF:** Shows a GIF while processing the image.

## Technologies Used

- **Python:** Programming language used for the application.
- **PyQt5:** Framework for creating the graphical user interface (GUI).
- **TensorFlow:** Library for deep learning and model inference.
- **PIL (Pillow):** Used for image processing.
- **win32com:** Provides text-to-speech functionality.
